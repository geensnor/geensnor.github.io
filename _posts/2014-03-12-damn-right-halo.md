> _Today, our hidden-in-the-crack gem comes is in the form of “Halo” from the electro-pop trio, Damn Right!, that’s based out of Philadelphia. These guys have been making music together for well over six years now, but as far as putting out buzz-worthy tracks, we have a feeling that “Halo” is going to top everything they’ve released prior to this point, and with one listen to “Halo”, we think you may be hard-pressed to disagree with us. Be on the lookout for their new album dropping soon._
